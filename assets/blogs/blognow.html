          <p>
            Life is a big deal. Especially, when you are trying to make it big, sometimes huge. 
            Whenever I’m thinking about creating something big and achieving extraordinary accomplishments
             there is only one person in this world who is at the top of my head.
            Cristiano Ronaldo.
  
            <p>
              Cristiano has been a major part of my life. Like family, friends, memories, journeys and a lot of other things that I love.
             And it is obvious for me to accept that football is something that I cannot express with my words alone.
            </p>
              <p>
                It is a major part of me since I started enjoying the love of football when I was 11 years old. Football has made me cry,
               football has made me scream, football has made me jump with excitement surely a large amount of times and the best
                thing football has taught me is the gift of enjoying the game with pure harmony of all the inner feelings. 
                Cristiano Ronaldo has been there with me all this time since or I may say in a cheerful manner that I have always been there
                 for him… (I guess that’s obvious) at all his ups and downs of life.
              </p>
            To me he will always the one of the biggest inspirations in life.
            Love you Cristiano. <i class="fa fa-heart text-danger"></i>
            Vida longa Cristiano !
