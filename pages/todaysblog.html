        <h3 class="text-light lead">Looking for resources:</h3>
        <p class="text-light">I have been looking for some resources to study and understand circuits with microcontrollers such as ardruino
          or microprocessors like early intel chips 8086 along with the interrupt controllers. I'm currently a final year
          student and I'm currently assigned the responsibility by the university to create a project that should be worthy of being categorized 
          as an innovation. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-light">Features that I want to be a part of my project:</p>
        <p>
            <ul class="text-light">
                <li>Interactable</li>
                <li>Responsive</li>
                <li>Fast</li>
                <li>User friendly</li>
                <li><strong>Amazing!</strong></li>
              </ul>
        </p> 
        <p class="text-light">
          I do have some ideas with me but the only thing I need to make sure it that I do perform my best to complete this project
          in time. The idea I've been giving a thought requires experience and operating simple circuits to control and manage voltages
          across different motors and controllers. Yes, I know you might be having some guesses popping onto your head right now and 
          yes maybe something like that yeah. Now I do have a few days to research on this topic to finalize the idea for my project
          but I'll need to make sure that I keep up with it. Yes, you know it too. It's not gonna happen if I don't. A bird is on the
          way.
